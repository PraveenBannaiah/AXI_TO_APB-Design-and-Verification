# AXI to APB Bridge – Design and Verification (In Progress)

## Overview
This project focuses on the **design and verification of an AXI to APB bridge**, intended to translate AXI transactions into APB-compliant transfers. The work is currently ongoing and is being developed as a learning and exploration project in on-chip interconnects and verification methodologies.

## Objectives
- Understand protocol differences between **AXI** and **APB**
- Implement basic address, data, and control signal translation
- Explore design trade-offs between performance and simplicity
- Develop a verification environment to observe and validate behavior

## Current Status
- RTL design: **in progress**
- Protocol handling: **partially implemented**
- Verification: **under development**
- Testbench: **being actively worked on**

## Design Scope
- AXI interface (simplified subset)
- APB interface (single peripheral model)
- Read and write transaction handling
- Basic state machine for protocol conversion

## Verification Approach
- Simulation-based verification
- Directed and constrained-random tests (in progress)
- Monitoring AXI and APB transactions
- Basic checking of protocol handshakes and data transfers

## Tools & Languages
- SystemVerilog
- Verilog
- Simulation tools (Questa)
